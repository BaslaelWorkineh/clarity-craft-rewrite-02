                    You know what? I'm honestly tired of people never getting my tone right. It's like, how hard is it to understand a simple message? Maybe if everyone used ClarityBubble, we wouldn't have to deal with all these misunderstandings. Actually, come to think of it, <span className="font-bold text-clarity-purple">I should probably use my own platform</span>â€”clearly, the world needs it (and so do I).<br /><br />
                    Communication shouldn't be this frustrating, but here we are. So, I built this tool to finally put an end to the madness. Enjoy.
